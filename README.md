The api routes are defined in `src/index.ts`.

The database models are defined inside the `src/models`.

## Setting up Production Environment

For production you need to build:

```bash

```

The files will be generated into the `dist/` directory.

To start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```

You can set up the environment files in a .env file or in the system environment.
